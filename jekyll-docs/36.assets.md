# Assets

Jekyll provides built-in support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and can work with [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) via a Ruby gem. In order to use them, you must first create a file with the proper extension name (one of `.sass`, `.scss`, or `.coffee`) and **_start the file with two lines of triple dashes_**, like this:

```
---
---

// start content
.my-definition
  font-size: 1.2em
```

Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site’s source folder, Jekyll will process it and put it in your site’s destination folder under `css/styles.css`.

##### Jekyll processes all Liquid filters and tags in asset files

If you are using [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) or another JavaScript templating language that conflicts with the [Liquid template syntax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/), you will need to place `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` tags around your code.

## Sass/SCSS[Permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#sassscss "Permalink")

Jekyll allows you to customize your Sass conversion in certain ways.

Place all your partials in your `sass_dir`, which defaults to`<source>/_sass`. Place your main SCSS or Sass files in the place you want them to be in the output file, such as `<source>/css`. For an example, take a look at [this example site using Sass support in Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/tree/master/docs).

If you are using Sass `@import` statements, you’ll need to ensure that your`sass_dir` is set to the base directory that contains your Sass files:

```
sass:
    sass_dir: _sass
```

The Sass converter will default the `sass_dir` configuration option to`_sass`.

##### The `sass_dir` is only used by Sass

Note that the `sass_dir` becomes the load path for Sass imports, nothing more. This means that Jekyll does not know about these files directly. Any files here should not contain the empty front matter as described above. If they do, they'll not be transformed as described above. This folder should only contain imports.

You may also specify the output style with the `style` option in your`_config.yml` file:

```
sass:
    style: compressed
```

These are passed to Sass, so any output style options Sass supports are valid here, too.

For more information on Sass configuration options, see the [Sass configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/sass/) docs.

## Coffeescript[Permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#coffeescript "Permalink")

To enable Coffeescript in Jekyll 3.0 and up you must

- Install the `jekyll-coffeescript` gem
- Ensure that your `_config.yml` is up-to-date and includes the following:

```
plugins:
  - jekyll-coffeescript
```
